# Copilot .Net Codeathon 

Welcome to the Copilot .Net codeathon repository! This repository serves as the perfect platform for tech enthusiasts and coding aficionados to embark on an exciting coding journey. Our Codeathons are designed to challenge your programming skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding adventure, you'll find something here to pique your interest.

Here's what you can expect from this repository:

1. **Codeathon Focus**: The primary purpose of this repository is to conduct the Copilot Codeathon. These codeathons are organized to foster a collaborative and competitive spirit among programmers.

2. **Programming Freedom**: For the first four challenges you have the freedom to code in any programming language of your choice. Whether you're a Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript enthusiast, you can use your preferred language to solve the problems. We encourage you to do them in C# though as the final challenge is a .Net application!

3. **Problem Statements**: We provide a curated set of programming problems, each presented as an individual issue within this repository. These problem statements are designed to be challenging, thought-provoking, and fun to solve.

4. **Testing Environment**: To ensure the validity and correctness of your solutions, we ask you to create unit test cases along with your solution. You can use these test cases to verify the functionality of your code.

5. **Sequential Challenges**: Your journey begins with the creation of a new repository using our template. Once your repository is set up, you will find the first Codeathon problem as an open issue. Your task is to implement a solution and close the issue once you're satisfied with your code.

6. **Progressive Learning**: As you complete each issue, the next problem statement will be automatically populated as a new issue. This progressive learning approach allows you to build upon your coding skills and tackle increasingly complex challenges.

The Copilot Codeathon Repository is not just a place to code; it's an opportunity to learn, grow, and showcase your coding prowess. We encourage collaboration, discussion, and sharing insights among participants. So, if you're ready to dive into the world of coding competitions and hone your skills, create a repository from this template and let the Codeathon begin!

### How to use this repository ❓

- **Main Branch**: The main branch is ready for you to start working on the different projects. If you are collaborating with other peers on the challenges make sure that you work on your individual branches and then create pull requests once the code is working! 

- **Demo Branch**: The demo branch contains the final, working code of the solution. It is ready for use and can be opened in a development container (DevContainer) or in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). You can start coding, running, and experimenting with the application right away.

Once you get started with the codeathon and go through the first challenges:

1. Add solution to corresponding folder. If the folder doesn't exist, create one like [challenge-1](./challenge-1) for each of the challenges **except the final challenge**.
2. Upload the app execution screen shots and test case execution screen shots to each challenge issue for later review 👀 

Happy coding! 🚀
