# Copilot .Net Demo

## Introduction

Welcome to the Copilot .Net Demo repository! This project showcases a basic .NET application designed to provide information about various regions, flags, and borders based on the name of a capital city. It serves as an excellent starting point for learning and experimenting with .NET development, as well as exploring the powerful capabilities of GitHub Copilot.

### Project Overview

This repository contains a well-structured .NET solution, featuring two main projects:

1. **Application (Console Application):** The heart of the project, this application is responsible for processing user input, fetching data, and providing relevant information about capital cities, regions, flags, and borders.

2. **Tests:** To ensure the reliability and correctness of the application, we've included a dedicated project for unit testing. It's crucial to maintain the quality and stability of the codebase.

Whether you're a seasoned .NET developer or just starting your coding journey, this repository is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of .NET development and the capabilities of GitHub Copilot.

## How to Use It

- **Main Branch**: The main branch contains the final, working code of the solution. It is ready for use and can be opened in a development container (DevContainer) or in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). You can start coding, running, and experimenting with the application right away.

- **Demo Branch**: For those interested in exploring how GitHub Copilot can assist in the development process, the demo branch provides the initial state of the application. It includes various commands, comments, and requirements specifically designed to be used with the help of Copilot. This branch offers an excellent opportunity to witness Copilot's code suggestions, completions, and collaborative coding features in action.

Feel free to clone, fork, or collaborate on this repository. It's a perfect playground to enhance your .NET skills and leverage GitHub Copilot to make your coding experience more productive and enjoyable.

Happy coding!
